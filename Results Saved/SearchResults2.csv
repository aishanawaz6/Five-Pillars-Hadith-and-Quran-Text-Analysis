1,Shahada,Hadith,"      Narrated Ibn 'Umar:                          Allah's Apostle said: ""I have been ordered (by Allah) to fight against     the people until they testify that none has the right to be worshipped     but Allah and that Muhammad is Allah's Apostle, and offer the prayers      perfectly and give the obligatory charity, so if they perform that,      then they save their lives and property from me except for Islamic laws     and then their reckoning (accounts) will be done by Allah."""
2,Shahada,Hadith,"      Narrated Abu Huraira:                          One day while the Prophet was sitting in the company of some people,      (The angel) Gabriel came and asked, ""What is faith?"" Allah's Apostle      replied, 'Faith is to believe in Allah, His angels, (the) meeting with     Him, His Apostles, and to believe in Resurrection."" Then he further      asked, ""What is Islam?"" Allah's Apostle replied, ""To worship Allah      Alone and none else, to offer prayers perfectly to pay the compulsory      charity (Zakat) and to observe fasts during the month of Ramadan.""       Then he further asked, ""What is Ihsan (perfection)?"" Allah's Apostle      replied, ""To worship Allah as if you see Him, and if you cannot      achieve this state of devotion then you must consider that He is      looking at you."" Then he further asked, ""When will the Hour be      established?"" Allah's Apostle replied, ""The answerer has no better      knowledge than the questioner. But I will inform you about its      portents.     1. When a slave (lady) gives birth to her master.     2. When the shepherds of black camels start boasting and competing      with others in the construction of higher buildings. And the Hour is      one of five things which nobody knows except Allah.     The Prophet then recited: ""Verily, with Allah (Alone) is the knowledge     of the Hour--."" (31. 34) Then that man (Gabriel) left and the Prophet      asked his companions to call him back, but they could not see him.      Then the Prophet said, ""That was Gabriel who came to teach the people      their religion."" Abu 'Abdullah said: He (the Prophet) considered all      that as a part of faith."
